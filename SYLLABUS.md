Course: DS-640 Predictive Analytics & Forecasting Modeling
Instructor: Metin Senturk
Email: msenturk@saintpeters.edu
```

## Prerequisites

A familiarity with basic mathematical operations and functions.
A familiarity with basic excel functions.
A familiarity with Python Programming and basic Machine Learning concepts.

## Course Outline

Analytics has been defined as the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and
predictive models, and fact-based management to drive decisions and actions. Analytics is more than just
analytical methodologies or techniques used in logical analysis. It is a process of transforming data into actions
through analysis and insights in the context of organizational decision making and problem solving. Analytics
includes a range of activities, including business intelligence, which is comprised of standard and ad hoc
reports, queries, and alerts; and quantitative methods, including statistical analysis, forecasting/ extrapolation,
predictive modeling (such as data mining), optimization and simulation.
The course will focus on various predictive analytics models and techniques. This course provides students
with the fundamental concepts and tools needed to understand the emerging role of predictive analytics in
organizations.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Assess and analyze data using the techniques and tools of analytics.
- Implement advanced predictive modeling techniques supporting the conceptual drive of the functions.
- Articulate the advantages of disadvantages of applying a specific technique to a predictive task.
